**🛡️ Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis – Power BI Dashboard**

**📌 Project Overview**

This is a personal Power BI project focused on analyzing insurance policy and claims data to understand risk patterns and claim behavior. The objective was to design a centralized, interactive dashboard that brings together scattered policy and claims information and transforms it into clear, data-driven insights.

The dashboard provides a structured view of key insurance metrics, customer demographics, and vehicle-related factors, helping explore how different attributes influence claim frequency and claim severity.

**🎯 Problem Statement:**

Insurance policy and claims data are often complex and spread across multiple tables, making it difficult to analyze overall trends and risk factors.
In this project, the challenge was to organize raw insurance data and create meaningful visualizations that could answer questions such as:

**How large is the policyholder base?**

**What is the total and average claim amount?**

**Which customer and vehicle attributes are associated with higher claims?**

**How do demographics and car details influence insurance risk?**

**🧠 Solution Approach:**

Cleaned and prepared insurance policy and claims datasets

Modeled relationships between policyholder, vehicle, and claims data

Created dynamic measures for Total Policies and Total Claim Amount

Built KPI cards and interactive visuals for exploratory analysis

Used slicers and filters to allow flexible data exploration

**All visualizations were designed around two core measures:**

Total Policies

Total Claim Amount


**📊 Key KPIs:**

Total Policies – Measures the size of the active policy base

Total Claim Amount – Tracks overall claim value

Claim Frequency – Indicates how often claims occur

Average Claim Amount – Helps assess claim severity

Gender-wise Total Policies – Shows customer distribution by gender


**📈 Visual Analysis:**

By Car Use (Donut Chart): Policy and claim distribution by vehicle usage

By Car Make (Bar Chart): Brand-level policy and claim comparison

By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart): Geographic distribution of policies and claims

By Age Group (Histogram): Age-wise policy and claim frequency analysis

By Car Year (Area Chart): Impact of vehicle age on policies and claims

By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart): Effect of young drivers on risk patterns

By Education (Pie Chart): Insurance adoption and claims by education level

By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid): Combined demographic risk analysis
